# Invite Users to Your Organization

To invite users to your organization:

## From the CLI

Run `brev invite` to generate an invite link and share it with a teammate. This will prompt your teammate to create an account if they don't have one already.

## From the Console
Go to your org settings page in the [Brev console](https://console.brev.dev){:target="_blank"}

From the Organization dropdown at the top, click on the gear ⚙️ for your organization.
