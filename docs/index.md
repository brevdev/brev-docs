# Welcome to Brev! ðŸ¤™
Brev is a cloud computer for local development. Use your local tools with a dedicated cloud computer.

##  Getting Started

**1. Create an account**

Make an account in the [Brev console](https://console.brev.dev). Follow the prompts to set up SSH and install the CLI




**2. Your first dev environment will be created automatically**

It's a simple react app. Brev wraps ssh to make it easy to hop into your environment, so with the CLI, run one of the following commands in your terminal: 

To SSH your terminal into your dev environment:
```
brev shell first-workspace-react
```
or SSH VS Code into your dev environment with:
```
brev open first-workspace-react # ssh with vscode into your dev environment
```

That's it ðŸŽ‰

Try creating your own dev environment [here](https://console.brev.dev/environment/new) and reach out to us in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NVDyv7TUgJ) for help! We're here for anything you need. Build something great ðŸ¤™
