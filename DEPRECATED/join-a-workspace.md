# How to Join a Workspace 

to join a workspace in your orginization, you can run 
`brev start <workspace name>` where `<workspace name>` is the name of a 
workspace that another member of that org has started. 

to list workspaces in your org, run 
```
brev ls --all
```

which has an output similar to

```
You have 1 workspaces in Org brev.dev
 NAME                             STATUS    URL                                                                       ID        
 brev-cli                         RUNNING   brev-cli-p09m-brevdev.wgt-us-west-2-test.brev.
Connect to running workspace:
        brev open brev-cli      # brev open <NAME> -> open workspace in preferred editor
        brev shell brev-cli     # brev shell <NAME> -> ssh into workspace (shortcut)
        ssh brev-cli-p09m       # ssh <SSH-NAME> -> ssh directly to workspace
Or ssh:
        ssh brev-cli-p09m
        ssh brev-docs-xp43
